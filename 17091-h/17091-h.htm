<div class = "scenedesc">
<span class = "charname">Cromwell's</span> house at Ely, about the year
1639. An early summer evening. The window of the room opens on to a
smooth lawn, used for bowling, and a garden full of flowers.</div>

<div class = "scenedesc">
<span class = "charname">Oliver's</span> wife, <span class =
"charname">Elizabeth Cromwell</span>, is sitting at the table, sewing.
In a chair by the open window <span class = "charname">Mrs.
Cromwell</span>, his mother, is reading. She is eighty years of
age.</div>

<div class = "speaker">
Mrs. Cromwell:</div>
<p>Oliver troubles me, persuading everywhere. Restless like this.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Elizabeth:</div>
<p>He says that the time is uneasy, and that we are part of&nbsp;it.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Mrs. Cromwell:</div>
<p>There's a man's house. It's enough surely.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Elizabeth:</div>
<p>I know. But Oliver must be doing. You know how when he took the
magistracy he would listen to none of us. He knows best.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Mrs. Cromwell:</div>
<p>What time is John coming?</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Elizabeth:</div>
<p>By nightfall he said. Henry Ireton is coming with him.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
<span class = "pagenum">4</span>
Mrs. Cromwell:</div>
<p>John Hampden is like that, too. He excites the boy.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Elizabeth:</div>
<p>Yes, but mother, you will do nothing with Oliver by thinking of him
as a boy.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Mrs. Cromwell:</div>
<p>Of course he's a boy.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Elizabeth:</div>
<p>He's forty.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Mrs. Cromwell:</div>
<p>Methuselah.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Elizabeth:</div>
<p>What?</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Mrs. Cromwell:</div>
<p>I said Methuselah.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Elizabeth:</div>
<p>He says John's the bravest man in England.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Mrs. Cromwell:</div>
<p>Just because he won't pay a tax. How if everybody refused to pay
taxes? If you don't have taxes, I don't see how you are to have a
government. Though I can't see that it governs anybody, except those
that don't need&nbsp;it.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Elizabeth:</div>
<p>Oliver says it's a wrong tax, this ship money.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Mrs. Cromwell:</div>
<p>There's always something wrong. It keeps men busy, I suppose.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Elizabeth:</div>
<p>But it was brave of John.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Mrs. Cromwell:</div>
<p>I know, I know. But why must he come here to-night of all in the
year?
<span class = "pagenum">5</span>
Oliver's like somebody out of the Bible about to-morrow as it is. This
will make him worse. I wish John no harm, but&mdash;well, I hope he's
got a bad horse.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Elizabeth:</div>
<p>Oliver's mind is made up about the common, whatever happens. John
will make no difference.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Mrs. Cromwell:</div>
<p>You can't pretend he'll make him more temperate.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Elizabeth:</div>
<p>It's very wrong to take away the common from the people. I think
Oliver is right.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Mrs. Cromwell:</div>
<p>Of course he's right. But I'm too old. I've seen too many broken
heads. He'll be no righter for a broken head.</p>

<div class = "stagedir first">
(<span class = "charname">Bridget Cromwell</span>, a girl, comes. She
takes some eggs from her apron and puts them on a dish on a
shelf.)</div>

<div class = "speaker">
Bridget:</div>
<p>Why, grandmother, whose head is to be broken?</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Mrs. Cromwell:</div>
<p>Your father's is like to&nbsp;be.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Bridget:</div>
<p>You mean to-morrow?</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Elizabeth:</div>
<p>At the meeting, yes.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Bridget:</div>
<p>But he must do it. Why, the people have fished and kept cattle there
<span class = "pagenum">6</span>
longer than any one can remember. Who is an Earl of Bedford to take it
away from them? I know I would let my head be broken first.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Elizabeth:</div>
<p>It is said that the King gave leave.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Bridget:</div>
<p>Then the King gave what wasn't his to give.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Mrs. Cromwell:</div>
<p>Now, child, don't you encourage your father, too. He's eager enough
without that.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Bridget:</div>
<p>But I must, grandmother. There's too much of this kind of
interference everywhere. Father says that Cousin John Hampden
says&mdash;</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Mrs. Cromwell:</div>
<p>And that's three of you in one house. And this young Mr. Ireton has
ideas, too, I believe.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Bridget:</div>
<p>Mr. Ireton is twenty-eight.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Mrs. Cromwell:</div>
<p>That accounts for&nbsp;it.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Bridget:</div>
<p>You don't think they just ought to be allowed to take the common
away, do you, grandmother?</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Mrs. Cromwell:</div>
<p>It makes no matter what I think.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
<span class = "pagenum">7</span>
Bridget:</div>
<p>Of course you don't. None of us do. We couldn't.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Elizabeth:</div>
<p>You mustn't tease your grandmother, Bridget.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Mrs. Cromwell:</div>
<p>She's a very old lady, and can't speak for herself.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Bridget:</div>
<p>I meant no ill manners, grandmother.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Mrs. Cromwell:</div>
<p>Never mind your manners child. But don't encourage your father. He
doesn't need it. This house is all commotion as it&nbsp;is.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Bridget:</div>
<p>I can't help it. There's so much going on everywhere. The King
doesn't deal fairly by people, I'm sure. Men like father must say
it.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Elizabeth:</div>
<p>Have you put the lavender in the rooms?</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Bridget:</div>
<p>No. I'll take it now.</p>

<div class = "stagedir first">
(She takes a tray from the window and goes out.)</div>

<div class = "speaker">
Mrs. Cromwell:</div>
<p>I don't know what will happen. I sometimes think the world isn't
worth quarrelling about at all. And yet I'm a silly old woman to talk
like that. But
<span class = "pagenum">8</span>
Oliver is a brave fellow&mdash;and John, all of them. I want them to be
brave in peace&mdash;that's the way you think at eighty.</p>
<div class = "stagedir">
(Reading.)</div> This Mr. Donne is a very good poet, but he's rather
hard to understand. I suppose that is being eighty, too. Mr. Herrick is
very simple. John Hampden sent me some copies from a friend who knows
Mr. Herrick. I like them better than John does.
<div class = "stagedir">
(She takes up a manuscript book and reads:)</div>

<div class = "versepair">
Lord, Thou hast given me a cell<br>
Wherein to dwell;</div>
<div class = "versepair">
A little house, whose humble roof<br>
Is waterproof;</div>
<div class = "versepair">
Under the spars of which I lie<br>
Both soft and dry....</div>

<p>But Mr. Shakespeare was best of all, I do believe. A very civil
gentleman, too. I spoke to him once&mdash;that was forty years ago, the
year Oliver was born, I remember. He didn't hold with all this talk
against kings.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Elizabeth:</div>
<p>There are kings and kings. Oliver finds no offence in
kings&mdash;it's in a king.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Mrs. Cromwell:</div>
<p>Well, it's all very dangerous,
<span class = "pagenum">9</span>
and I'm too old for it. Not but what Oliver's brain is better than mine.
But we have to sit still and watch. However</p>
<div class = "stagedir">
(reading)&mdash;</div>

<div class = "versepair">
Lord, 'tis thy plenty-dropping hand<br>
That sows my land:</div>
<div class = "versepair">
All this, and better, dost thou send<br>
Me for this end:</div>
<div class = "versepair">
That I should render for my part<br>
A thankful heart,</div>
<div class = "versepair">
Which, fired with incense, I resign<br>
As wholly Thine:</div>
<div class = "versepair">
But the acceptance&mdash;that must be,<br>
O Lord, by Thee.</div>

<p>Mr. Herrick has chosen a nice name for his book. Hesperides. He has
taste as well as understanding.</p>

<div class = "stagedir first">
(The sound of horsemen arriving is heard.)</div>

<div class = "speaker">
Elizabeth:</div>
<p>That will be John and Mr. Ireton.</p>

<div class = "stagedir first">
(She looks from the window, puts her work into a box, and goes
out.)</div>

<div class = "speaker">
Mrs. Cromwell</div>
<div class = "stagedir">
(turning her pages):</div>

<div class = "versepair">
Ye have been fresh and green,<br>
Ye have been filled with flowers,</div>
<div class = "versepair">
<span class = "pagenum">10</span>
And ye the walks have been<br>
Where maids have spent their hours.</div>

<div class = "versepair first">
Like unthrifts, having spent<br>
Your stock, and needy grown,</div>
<div class = "versepair">
You're left here to lament<br>
Your poor estates alone.</div>

<div class = "stagedir first">
(<span class = "charname">Elizabeth</span> comes back with <span class =
"charname">John Hampden</span>, aged forty-four, and <span class =
"charname">Henry Ireton</span>, twenty-eight. They both shake hands with
<span class = "charname">Mrs. Cromwell</span>.)</div>

<div class = "speaker">
Hampden:</div>
<p>How do you do, ma'am?</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Mrs. Cromwell:</div>
<p>Well, John.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Ireton:</div>
<p>Good-evening, ma'am.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Mrs. Cromwell:</div>
<p>You're welcome, Master Ireton, I'm sure. If you behave yourself,
young man.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Ireton:</div>
<p>How may that be, ma'am?</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Mrs. Cromwell:</div>
<p>No, don't ask me. Only don't you and John come putting more notions
into Oliver's head. I'm sure he's got more than he can rightly manage as
it&nbsp;is.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Hampden:</div>
<p>We were told down there that it's to-morrow that my Lord of Bedford
and his like are to claim the common rights.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
<span class = "pagenum">11</span>
Elizabeth:</div>
<p>Yes.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Ireton:</div>
<p>Mr. Cromwell is to resist, they said.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Mrs. Cromwell:</div>
<p>Now, young man, Oliver doesn't need any urging to it. He needs
holding back.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Hampden:</div>
<p>But that's fine for Oliver. Every man must speak to-day&mdash;and do
as well, if it comes to&nbsp;it.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Mrs. Cromwell:</div>
<p>Yes, but don't be so proud about it, John.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Elizabeth:</div>
<p>I think they should be proud.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Mrs. Cromwell:</div>
<p>Remember what Mr. Herbert says&mdash;</p>

<div class = "versepair">
A servant with this clause<br>
Makes drudgerie divine.</div>
<div class = "versepair">
Who sweeps a room, as for thy laws,<br>
Makes that and th' action fine.</div>

<p>As for thy laws, remember.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Hampden:</div>
<p>Surely, we shall remember that always.</p>

<div class = "stagedir first">
(<span class = "charname">Bridget</span> comes in.)</div>

<div class = "speaker">
Bridget:</div>
<p>Cousin John.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Hampden:</div>
<p>Well, Bridget, my girl.</p>
<div class = "stagedir">
(He kisses her.)</div>

<div class = "speaker">
Bridget:</div>
<p>How do you do, Mr. Ireton?</p>

<div class = "speaker">
<span class = "pagenum">12</span>
Ireton</div>
<div class = "stagedir">
(shaking hands):</div>
<p>Well, I thank you, mistress.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Bridget:</div>
<p>Does father know, mother?</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Elizabeth:</div>
<p>I've sent down to the field.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Mrs. Cromwell:</div>
<p>He'll be here soon enough. I'm sorry the judges were against you,
John. I don't know what else you could expect, though. They are the
King's judges, I suppose.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Hampden:</div>
<p>That's what we dispute, ma'am. The King says that they should serve
him. We say that they should serve the laws.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Ireton:</div>
<p>It was just when Mr. Hampden was being heard. The law they said was
the King's old and loyal servant: that <i>lex</i> was not <i>rex</i>,
but that none could gainsay that <i>rex</i> was <i>lex</i>.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Hampden:</div>
<p>That's what we shall have to decide, and before long, I think.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Bridget:</div>
<p>Father says that.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Mrs. Cromwell:</div>
<p>This house is ready for any kind of revolution, John.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Ireton:</div>
<p>But you find it everywhere, ma'am. All along the countryside, in the
markets, in the church porches&mdash;everywhere.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Elizabeth:</div>
<p>Is the vine doing well this year, John?</p>

<div class = "speaker">
<span class = "pagenum">13</span>
Hampden:</div>
<p>It's the best year I remember.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Elizabeth:</div>
<p>Ours, too.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Bridget:</div>
<p>Were you there, Mr. Ireton, when Cousin John's case was tried?</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Ireton:</div>
<p>Yes.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Bridget:</div>
<p>It was splendid, wasn't it&mdash;although he lost, I mean?</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Ireton:</div>
<p>It was the note of deliverance.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Bridget:</div>
<p>I wish I could have been there, Cousin John.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Mrs. Cromwell:</div>
<p>Will you give me my shawl, Henry Ireton.</p>
<div class = "stagedir">
(He does so.)</div>
<p>There's Oliver coming. Now you can all be thunder.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Bridget:</div>
<p>Now, grandmother, you know you don't think it's just that.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Mrs. Cromwell:</div>
<p>So you have hope for me yet, miss?</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Bridget:</div>
<p>Grandmother.</p>

<div class = "stagedir first">
(<span class = "charname">Cromwell</span> comes in. He is in plain
country dress. His age is forty.)</div>

<div class = "speaker">
Cromwell:</div>
<p>John&mdash;it's good to see you. You're an hour before reckoning.</p>
<div class = "stagedir">
(Taking <span class = "charname">Hampden's</span> hand.)</div>

<div class = "speaker">
Hampden:</div>
<p>Yes, Oliver. Is all well?</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Cromwell:</div>
<p>Not that&mdash;but our courage is
<span class = "pagenum">14</span>
well enough. You are very welcome, Henry.</p>
<div class = "stagedir">
(Taking his hand.)</div>
<p>Was it good travelling?</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Ireton:</div>
<p>Not a bad mile on the journey.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Bridget:</div>
<p>Father, Mr. Ireton heard Cousin John's case tried. Wasn't he
lucky?</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Cromwell:</div>
<p>Whoever heard that heard history being made, John. It was a great
example to set.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Hampden:</div>
<p>One works from the spirit, Oliver.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Cromwell:</div>
<p>That's what we must do. You've heard about this affair down here?</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Hampden:</div>
<p>The common? Yes.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Cromwell:</div>
<p>There's to be no yielding about that.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Hampden:</div>
<p>I'm glad of it, Oliver.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Mrs. Cromwell:</div>
<p>What will it all come to, John?</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Cromwell:</div>
<p>There are times, mother, when we may not count the cost.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Mrs. Cromwell:</div>
<p>You're very vexatious sometimes, Oliver.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Cromwell:</div>
<p>But you know I'm right in this, mother.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Mrs. Cromwell:</div>
<p>Being right doesn't make you less vexatious.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
<span class = "pagenum">15</span>
Elizabeth:</div>
<p>Have they finished in Long Close?</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Cromwell:</div>
<p>Yes. They will be here soon.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Bridget:</div>

<p>Brethren in God, at the end of another day's labour we are met to
praise Him from whom are the means to labour and its rewards. As we go
about these fields, He is with us. As you deal by me, and I by you, His
eye sees us. Nothing good befalls us but it is by His will, no
affliction is ours but His loving mercy will hear us. The Lord God walks
at our hand. He is here now in our midst. His desires are our freedom,
His wrath our tyranny one over another. Be very merciful in all your
ways, for mercy is His name. May His counsel be always with our little
fellowship. If I should fail towards any man, let him speak. May we be
as brothers always, one to another. And may we serve Him to serve whom
alone is wisdom. In Jesus Christ's name, Amen. "All people that on earth
do dwell."</p>

the Earl of Bedford keep within his own palings. There are lessons, say

Hampden's ship money will be a King's lesson, I tell you.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Hampden:</div>
<p>You should tell your masters all that you see and hear. Do not
flatter them. Let it be the truth. Say that men talk everywhere, more
and more openly. Tell them that you heard John Hampden say that the

in treating Mr. Prynne and Mr. Bastwick so. Say that you and your like
are reviled by all honest men.</p>

<p>I should not speak to you but in the hope that you will report it to
those that should know. I am a plain burgess of this city. I farm a few
lands and am known to none. But I have a faith that the people of this
country are born to be, under God, a free people. That is the
fundamental principle of this English life, If your masters, be they who
they may, forget that, then, as you say, there will be lessons to be
learnt. Here in Ely it is my part to see that my fellows do not lose
their birthright. You shall not find us ignorant nor afraid. I would
have no violence; let all be by persuasion
<span class = "pagenum">24</span>
and tolerance. But these just liberties must not be touched. Will you
ask my Lord of Bedford to reconsider this?</p>

The Commons of England in session at St. Hepburn's Chapel, Westminster,

<div class = "speaker">
The Member:</div>
<p>That the grievances set out in this Remonstrance now before you are
just is clear. The matter has been debated by us these eight hours, and
none has been able to deny the wrongs which are here set forth. It is
not well with our state, and correction is needed. Mr. Ireton has very
clearly shown us how this is. But we must be wary. The King is the King,
a necessary part, as it must seem to us, of the government of this
country.</p>

<div class = "stagedir first">
(There are murmurs for and against this; assent in the majority.)</div>

<p class = "first">
To pass this Remonstrance can be no other than to pass a vote of no
confidence in that King. Consider this. Saying so much, how shall you
deny to overthrow the crown if
<span class = "pagenum">29</span>
need be? And who among you is willing to bear that burden?</p>

<div class = "stagedir first">
(The murmurs grow to conflicting cries.)</div>

<p class = "first">
I beseech you let us not commit ourselves thus. Nor do not think I am
weak in zeal. There are evil counsellors with the King, and they would
destroy us. Our liberties must be looked to. But there should be
moderation in this act. We should choose some other way. We must defend
ourselves, but we must not challenge the King's authority&nbsp;so.</p>

<div class = "stagedir first">
(He sits down to a confusion of voices, and <span class =
"charname">Hampden</span> rises.)</div>

<div class = "speaker">
Hampden:</div>
<p>My friend, I think, is deceived. This Remonstrance is not against the
King. It is from the people of this country against a policy. We desire
no judgment&mdash;all we ask is redress. If we assert ourselves as in
this instrument, we but put the King in the way of just government. I
think the King hardly knows the measure of his wrongs against us, and I
say it who have suffered.</p>

<div class = "stagedir first">
(A murmur of assent.)</div>

<p class = "first">
To speak clearly as is here done will, I think, be to mend his mind
towards us. This Remonstrance has been drawn with all
<span class = "pagenum">30</span>
care. Not only is its intent free of blame towards the King's majesty
and person, but it can, I hope, be read by no fair-minded man in the way
that my friend fears. If I thought that, I should consider more closely
my support of it. But I have considered with all patience, and it seems
to me good.</p>

<div class = "stagedir first">
(He sits, and again there is a rattle of argument. <span class =

<div class = "speaker">
Cromwell:</div>
<p>Sir, this is a day when every man must speak the truth that is in
him, or be silent in shame, and for ever. Mr. Hampden is my kinsman, as
you know, one who has my best affection. His word has ever been a
strength among us, and no man here but knows his valiance in the cause.
His has been a long suffering, and his integrity but ripens. But I do
not read this occasion as he does, nor, let me say, do I fear it as does
our friend who spoke before. That gentleman pleads that this
Remonstrance is a vote of want of confidence in the King, such as none
of us would willingly pass. Mr. Hampden replies that it is no such vote.
I say to you that it is such a vote, and that I would pass it
<span class = "pagenum">31</span>
with all my heart. Sir, this country, the spirit of man in this country,
has suffered grievances too great to be borne. By whom are they laid
upon us? I say it is by the King. Is a man's estate secure to himself?
Does not the King pass upon it levies for his own designs? You know that
it is so. Is there not ship money? Mr. Hampden can tell you. Is not that
the King's affair? Is there not a Star Chamber? Ask Mr. Prynne and those
others. These men disliked the King's church&mdash;a very dangerous
church as it seems to me&mdash;and were bold to say so. And for that
each was fined five thousand pounds, and had his ears cut off, and is
now in prison for life. And does not the Star Chamber belong to the
King? Who among you can deny it? And this land is bruised, I tell you,
by such infamies. There is no sureness in a man for his purse or his
body, or his conscience. The King,&mdash;not the head of the state, mark
you, expressing the people's will in one authority,&mdash;but this man
Charles Rex, may use all these as he will. I aim not to overthrow the
monarchy. I know its use and fitness in the
<span class = "pagenum">32</span>
realm, as well as any. But this can endure no longer. The King is part
of the state, but we have a King who has sought to put the state to his
private use. The King should have his authority, but it is an authority
subject to the laws of the people. This King denies it, and his judges
flatter the heresy. You have but one question before you&mdash;there is
in truth but one raised by this Remonstrance. Is England to be governed
by the King or by elected representatives of the people? That is what we
have now to decide, not for ourselves alone, but for our children in the
generations to come. If the King will profit by a lesson, I with any man
will be his loyal and loving subject. But at this moment a lesson must
be given. Why else have you appointed my Lord of Essex from Parliament
to take command of the armed forces of this country? Did you not fear
that the King would use these also against you? You know you did. I say
it again, this that is now to be put to you is a vote of want of
confidence in the King. I would it were so more expressly.</p>

<p>Sir, this question could not be argued to an end if we sat here for a

<p class = "letter">
My dear daughter, I am lately arrived in London, from Edgehill in the
county of Warwickshire,
<span class = "pagenum">42</span>
where for the first time our men met the King's army in set dispute. It
was late on the Sabbath afternoon, so that, as we lay for the attack,
the sound of church bells came to us from three or four places. The King
had the better ground, also they exceeded us in numbers, both horse and
foot, and in cannon. It is hard to say which way the battle went, the
advantage at one time being here, at another there. Their horsemen
behaved very well, being commanded by Prince Rupert, a soldier of great
courage in the field. Your Cousin Hampden managed a regiment with much
honour, and twice or thrice delivered our cause. We were engaged until
night stayed us. Some four thousand were slain, their loss, I hear,
being the greater. Of the sixty in my own troop, eighteen fell. We had
commendation from the General, and indeed I think we did not fail in
resolution. But this matter will not be accomplished save we build, as
it were, again from the foundation. This is God's service, and all must
be given. To which end I am now coming home, to call out all such men as
have the love of England
<span class = "pagenum">43</span>
in their hearts, and fear God. I shall labour with them. It seems to me
that I shall be called to great trust in this, and I will set such
example as I can. Expect me as soon as you receive this, for indeed I
leave London as soon almost as my letter. Your mother I saw here with
her nephew. She loves you as I do. Henry Ireton comes with me&mdash;he
served very stoutly at Edgehill, and hath a gunshot in the arm. None is
like to serve these times better than he. Give my loving duty to your
grandmother, which I shall at once deliver myself. God bless you.</p>

<p>Of that battle, yes. But I think the issue was there decided, some
few of us there learning what must now be done. Those few held firmly at
Edgehill, keeping us as far from defeat as we were, though that was
little enough. For our troops are most of them old decayed serving-men,
and tapsters, and such kind of fellows; and their troops are gentlemen's
sons, younger sons and persons of quality. Do you think that the spirits
of such base, mean fellows will ever be able to encounter gentlemen,
that have honour and courage and resolution in them? We must get men of
a spirit that is likely to go on as
<span class = "pagenum">47</span>
far as gentlemen will go, or we shall be beaten still. We must raise
such men as have the fear of God before them, such men as make some
conscience of what they do. We must do this, Mr. Mayor. I never thought
to use a sword, but now all must be given that it may be used well. I
would have you send a summons to all the people of this town and
countryside. Bid them meet two days hence in the market-place at noon. I
will tell them of all these things. I will show them how the heart of
England is threatened. We must give, we must be diligent in service, we
must labour. An army is to be made&mdash;we must make it. We have no
help but our own hands&mdash;by them alone we must save this country.
Will you send out this summons?</p>

(rising):</div>
<p>My friends, I know not to what labour you will next be called, but we
are upon dark and proving days, coming to memorable issues. The tyranny
that has worked among us so grievously and long now strikes at our all.
We must betake ourselves to defence, or this will be but a rotten realm,
fair for no man to live in henceforth. Do not be mistaken. In the way of
life out of which has come this menacing destruction upon us is much of
beauty, much of nobility, and the light of man's mind. These things it
will be for us in season to cherish and preserve. But where these have
been is no warrant for authority abused. And authority this day is an
abuse against us to the very pitch of wickedness. We are called to stand
for the charter of all men's faith, for the charter which is liberty,
which is God. Against us
<span class = "pagenum">56</span>
are arrayed the ranks of privilege. They are mighty, well used in arms,
fearless, and not easily to be turned aside. But we go to battle in the
name of God. Let every man consider it. Each one of you is here and now
called to service in that name, that hereafter in England a man may call
his hearth his own. And now may the love of God inform you. In humble
courage let us go forward, nourishing our strength, sure always in our
cause. May God bless us, and teach us the true valiance, and may He
spend us according to His will. Amen. The Lord is my Shepherd; I shall
not want.</p>

Fairfax:</div>
<p>Between Mill Hill, and Sulby Hall, there. Broad Moor&mdash;yes. You
measure their numbers at ten thousand, Staines?</p>

<p>Not more than ten, nor less than eight.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Fairfax:</div>
<p>Four thousand or so of them horse?</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Staines:</div>
<p>It is thought&nbsp;so.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Fairfax:</div>
<p>Yes, yes. We are eleven thousand, eh, Pemberton?</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Pemberton:</div>
<p>Eleven thousand and perhaps three hundred.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Fairfax:</div>
<p>Naseby will be three quarters&mdash;no, half a mile behind&nbsp;us.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Ireton:</div>
<p>The right of the field is boggy,
<span class = "pagenum">58</span>
and pitted by rabbits. The action is like to move to the left.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Fairfax:</div>
<p>Yes. There's a high hedge above there below Sulby. It would be useful
to us then.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Staines:</div>
<p>It has been marked, and dug almost to the waterside.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Fairfax:</div>
<p>Good. Skippon and myself with the infantry there and there. Then the
cavalry&mdash;you have one wing, Ireton, or you must command all, since
General Cromwell is not come.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Pemberton:</div>
<p>Is there any word of him?</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Fairfax:</div>
<p>None.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Staines:</div>
<p>They do not consider us at Westminster.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Ireton:</div>
<p>It is disastrous of them to hesitate so. They do not understand.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Fairfax:</div>
<p>No. I have told them that to-day is to be made the fiercest trial of
all, but they do not listen.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Pemberton:</div>
<p>Where is General Cromwell?</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Fairfax:</div>
<p>None knows. These months he has been up and down the land, exhorting,
stirring up opinion, watching the discipline
<span class = "pagenum">59</span>
of our new armies, lending his personal authority in bringing men's
minds to the cause. But to-day we need him here. He should have been
sent. We need him.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Ireton:</div>
<p>Urgently. Charles and Rupert are staking all on this.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Staines:</div>
<p>They were never in better tune. It is as though every man were
picked.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Fairfax:</div>
<p>I said this to Westminster.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Ireton:</div>
<p>We carry too many callow soldiers against them. Example will be
everything. General Cromwell and his chosen troops have that, and
experience; none like them.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Pemberton:</div>
<p>Does the General himself know of our necessity, do you think,
sir?</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Fairfax:</div>
<p>There is no tracing him. He almost certainly does not know, or he
would have insisted. There are rumours of him from the eastern counties,
of some activities with his men, but no more.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Ireton:</div>
<p>And the hope of England here in grave peril. Westminster is
disgraceful.</p>

the duty we owe to you and the public, to make it our suit."</p>

<div class = "speaker">

<p>Six o'clock, sir.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Pemberton:</div>
<p>Rupert is almost certain to see the weakness there.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Fairfax:</div>
<p>Yes, but there it is. Skippon must cover it as he can. We have spoken
of it very exactly.</p>

<div class = "speaker">

<p>If either wing of our horse breaks, it means certain disaster there,
even though Skippon could hold in the centre.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Fairfax:</div>
<p>That's Cromwell again. And all to satisfy the pride of a few useless
members that his self-denying ordinance keeps out of command.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Staines:</div>
<p>Do you think it's that, sir?</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Fairfax:</div>
<p>What else? They are more jealous that he should come to no more
honour than that we should succeed. And after all that has been
given.</p>

<p>The blood.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Pemberton:</div>
<p>It is abominable.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Fairfax:</div>
<p>But there&mdash;we must not distress ourselves. We have our own
loyalty. Keep in touch with Skippon, Staines. If you can push their
right foot up towards Sibbertoft

there, spare nothing in the doing. Have you all slept, gentlemen?</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Ireton and the others:</div>
<p>Yes, sir.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Fairfax:</div>

any man, perhaps. You will not be wanting, I know.</p>

<p>You are welcome; none can say how much.</p>

<p>A near thing, sir. I only heard from Westminster yesterday at

<div class = "speaker">
Fairfax:</div>
<p>They told us nothing.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Cromwell:</div>
<p>There are many poor creatures at Westminster, sir. Many of them, I

are in time, and that's all. Henry. Good-morning, gentlemen. How goes
it?</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Fairfax</div>
<div class = "stagedir">
(taking his seat, <span class = "charname">Cromwell</span> and the

<p>The battle is set. Our foot there, Skippon and myself. Colonel Ireton
and Whalley are with the horse. They are at your service.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Cromwell</div>
<div class = "stagedir">

<p>Then that is the point; it may be decisive there. You take the left,
Henry.</p>

Ireton:</div>
<p>Yes, sir.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Cromwell:</div>
<p>Let Whalley be on my left here&mdash;give him fifteen hundred. I have
six hundred. I'll take the right with them myself, Are you on the left,

Fairfax:</div>
<p>Yes, and the second line.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Cromwell:</div>
<p>Good&mdash;can I have two of the best regiments down here behind

<div class = "speaker">

<p>Yes. Staines, let Spilsby see to that.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Cromwell:</div>
<p>Spilsby is good.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Staines:</div>
<p>If I might say it, would you choose him for that, sir? It is a great
responsibility, and he has been indiscreet. I thought not to use him
to-day.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Cromwell:</div>
<p>Indiscreet?</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Staines:</div>
<p>In his utterances, sir. His belief is in some question.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Cromwell:</div>
<p>Surely you are not well advised to turn off one so faithful to the
cause, and so able to serve you as this man is. He is indiscreet, you
say. It may be so in some things; we all have human infirmities. Sir,
the state, in choosing men to serve it, takes no notice of their
opinions. If men be willing faithfully
<span class = "pagenum">67</span>
to serve it, that satisfies. Let it be Spilsby.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Staines:</div>
<p>Yes, sir.</p>

Sir,&mdash;This, of which the General advises you, is none other but the
hand of God, and to Him alone belongs the glory, wherein none are to
share with him. The General served you with all faithfulness and honour;
and the best commendation I can give him is, that I dare say he
attributes all to God, and would rather perish than assume to himself.
Which is an honest and a thriving way; and yet as much for bravery may
be given to him, in this action, as to a man. Honest men served you
faithfully in this action. Sir, they
<span class = "pagenum">70</span>
are trusty; I beseech you, in the name of God, not to discourage them. I
wish this action may beget thankfulness and humility in all that are
concerned in it. He that ventures his life for the liberty of his
country, I wish he trust God for the liberty of his conscience, and you
for the liberty he fights for. In this he rests, who is your most humble
servant....</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Cromwell:</div>
<p>We came, sir, to reassure ourselves.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Charles:</div>
<p>As to what?</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Cromwell:</div>
<p>Your Majesty knows that, in treating with you as we have done these
months past, we have been subject to suspicions.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Charles:</div>
<p>I imagined that it might be so. But your character and your
reputation, Mr. Cromwell, can ignore these.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Cromwell:</div>
<p>It is suggested that we become
<span class = "pagenum">76</span>
courtiers, and susceptible as courtiers are. But that is nothing.
Continually we are told that Your Majesty will outwit&nbsp;us.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Charles:</div>
<p>But that is too fantastic. Between men so open one with another. Our
scruples&mdash;persuasion&mdash;yes, these may take time. We may not
always easily understand each other there. But that there should be any
question of duplicity between us&mdash;it is monstrous. We may disagree,
stubbornly, Mr. Cromwell, but we know each the other's thought.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Cromwell:</div>
<p>I believe it. You know nothing of these Scotch agents in London?</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Charles:</div>
<p>Scotch?</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Ireton:</div>
<p>They arrived yesterday.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Charles:</div>
<p>Who are they?</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Cromwell:</div>
<p>You do not know, sir?</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Charles:</div>
<p>I? Indeed,&nbsp;no.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Cromwell:</div>
<p>I did not suppose it. But already I am beset by warnings. I dismiss
them, giving my word in this for your integrity, as it were.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Charles:</div>
<p>Minds are strained in these days, It is shameless of them to say
this.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
<span class = "pagenum">77</span>
Ireton:</div>
<p>It means so much, you see, sir. Intrigues with Scotland&mdash;there
are none, we are assured, but if there were it would almost inevitably
bring civil war again. The mere shadow of that in men's minds is enough,
indeed, to overthrow them. No man can consider the possibility of that
without desolation.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Charles:</div>
<p>No. That is unquestionable.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Cromwell:</div>
<p>And so I was minded to come, and be sure by word of mouth, so to
speak. Your Majesty knows how suspicions creep in absence, even of those
whom we trust. And I have shown, sir, that I trust you.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Charles:</div>
<p>We are not insensitive.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Ireton:</div>
<p>It is of that trust, truly worn, sir, that we may all yet look for a
happy settlement.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Charles:</div>
<p>It is my hope, devoutly.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Cromwell:</div>
<p>Parliament bends a little to my persuasion. If I could but induce
Your Majesty to treat no longer directly with them, but to leave all to
me.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Charles:</div>
<p>It is our Parliament still. We cannot slight them.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
<span class = "pagenum">78</span>
Cromwell:</div>
<p>But, sir, you confuse things daily. If the army were no longer
intact, it would be another matter. But now it is the army that must be
satisfied&mdash;in the end there is the real authority. Remember, sir,
that these men are not merely soldiers. They are the heart and the
conscience of the nation in arms. By their arms thay have prevailed, how
bloodily Your Majesty knows. They stand now to see that the settlement
is not against that conscience that armed them.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Charles:</div>
<p>But we must consider ourselves. It would be folly to anger the
House.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Cromwell:</div>
<p>The House can do nothing without us. And I have considered you, sir.
I have persuaded the army that the monarchy is the aptest form of
government for this country. It was difficult, but my belief has
prevailed. I have even won respect for Your Majesty's person. Do but
give us our guarantees, and you will mount a securer throne, I think,
than any king has yet held in England.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Charles:</div>
<p>But Parliament&mdash;</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Ireton:</div>
<p>No, sir. Parliament's demands are
<span class = "pagenum">79</span>
not our demands. To give them what they ask will be to lose all opinion
in the army. That would be fatal.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Cromwell:</div>
<p>Parliament and the army are at one in asking for constitutional
safeguards. All are agreed on that. But after that we are in dispute,
irreconcileably. They want a Presbyterian despotism. This land, sir, has
had enough of despotism, and we will not exchange one despotism for
another. We, the army, demand liberty of opinion. We respect law, we
stand, above all, for order and right behaviour, for an observance of
the rights of others. But we demand that a man's thought shall be his
own, that his faith shall be directed by none. We stand for Bible
freedom. And we, sir, are strong enough to make Parliament accept that,
but Parliament can never make us accept the tyranny of the Presbyters.
We are the new Independents, sir, the Independents of the spirit. We are
determined that henceforth in England no man shall suffer for his
faith.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Charles:</div>
<p>I respect these ambitions.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Ireton:</div>
<p>Do but let us go to the army with
<span class = "pagenum">80</span>
that respect, and not a trooper but will renew your power for you.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Charles:</div>
<p>A power a little cropped, eh, Mr. Ireton?</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Cromwell:</div>
<p>No, sir, enlarged. You have ruled by interest and fear. You can go
back to rule by the affection of a free people. You have the qualities,
sir&mdash;why waste them?</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Charles:</div>
<p>You persuade well. Honestly, I am sure.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Cromwell:</div>
<p>I could take all. I do not want it. I want to restore your fortune,
to give you back a regenerate kingship. Will you take it, sir? It is of
love I offer it, love of England, of your great office. And you should
adorn that inheritance. Men should be proud to call you King, sir.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Ireton:</div>
<p>We have that pride&mdash;and we have suffered.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Cromwell:</div>
<p>I can disabuse rumour about Scotland, I can persuade Parliament about
the Presbytery, I can convince the army of your good faith as to
tolerance, if you will but give me the word. Let us together make
Charles Rex the noblest name of Christendom.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
<span class = "pagenum">81</span>
Charles:</div>
<p>How shall I stand with the Episcopacy?</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Cromwell:</div>
<p>All tyrannies must go together. We mislike no bishops save that they
stand by a tyrannous church. That we will destroy. It is there as I have
said. We attack not faiths or opinions, but despotism. Let a man think
as he will, but he shall command no other man to think&nbsp;it.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Ireton:</div>
<p>We will not persecute even our persecutors. But they shall stay their
hands, now and for ever.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Cromwell:</div>
<p>This is just; merciful even. Will you work with us together, sir, to
the salvation of our country?</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Charles:</div>
<p>You are very patient.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Cromwell:</div>
<p>To great ends. Why do you deliberate, sir? What invention is needed?
All is so plain. And many wish you disaster. If you refuse this, it may
be hard to deny them.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Charles:</div>
<p>We do not fear disaster.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Cromwell:</div>
<p>But I offer you an ascendancy undreamt of. It should be plain.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Charles:</div>
<p>You offer much, and it should
<span class = "pagenum">82</span>
prosper. Or I think so. But I must consider. One has old habits, not
easily to be put by. One grows to kingship thus, or thus&mdash;the
manner does not readily change. But I will consider&nbsp;it.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Cromwell:</div>
<p>Time presses.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Charles:</div>
<p>Yes, but a day or two. Say three days.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Cromwell:</div>
<p>Three days, then, sir. I brought Your Majesty this.</p>
<div class = "stagedir">
(He takes a miniature from his pouch.)</div>
<p>It is newly drawn by Mr. Cooper. It is of a young man, Andrew
Marvell, of whose verses Your Majesty would think well. He should do
much. Cooper has drawn it well&mdash;it's very decisive in line,
sir?</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Charles:</div>
<p>Yes. A little heavy there in the nostril, perhaps, but good. Yes,
very.</p>

Charles:</div>
<p>I have heard him say&nbsp;so.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Cromwell:</div>
<p>It's generous of him&mdash;the methods are so different.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Charles:</div>
<p>Van Dyck draws marvellously in sanguine.</p>
<div class = "stagedir">
(He takes a drawing from the drawer

in front of him and places it before Cromwell, on the case of
papers.)</div>
<p>That approaches any of the masters, I think.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Cromwell:</div>
<p>Good&mdash;yes. And yet Hans Holbein was incomparable&mdash;not so
assertive&mdash;no, copious, and yet as complete, simpler.
But&mdash;yes, there is great dignity here.</p>

the table, when his glance falls on <span class =

nothing, but a second glance arrests all his movement. After a moment he
turns to look fixedly at the King. There is a silence; then:)</div>

<p>The Scots to invade England. The King's arms to be raised again.
Presbytery to... Freedom to be destroyed&mdash;and diligently, at the

Charles:</div>
<p>We are not before our judges.</p>

<p>It will come. This iniquity means we know not what new bitterness of
destruction. But know this, Charles Stuart, that, when we draw the sword
again, it is the sword of judgment. Out there many call you the man of
blood. I have laboured for you, have met them all in persuasion. I had
prevailed. It is finished. Blood is upon us again, blood spilled for a
perfidious king. The sword that we had put by for ever! My God, how I
have feared it! Well, so be it. We go to the field again&mdash;but then,
prepare you for the reckoning. It shall be to the uttermost.</p>

Mrs. Cromwell:</div>
<p>Yes, just a little. Mr. Milton was reading to me this afternoon. Your
father asked him to come. He has begun a very good poem, about Eden and
the fall of man. He read me some of it. He writes extremely well. I
think I should like to hear something by that young Mr. Marvell. He
copies them out for me&mdash;you'll find them in that book, there.
There's one about a garden. Just two stanzas of it. I have marked
them.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Bridget</div>
<div class = "stagedir">
(reading):</div>

<div class = "verse">
How vainly men themselves amaze<br>
To win the palm, the oak, or bays,<br>
And their incessant labours see<br>
Crown'd from some single herb or tree,<br>
Whose short and narrow-verged shade<br>
Does prudently their toils upbraid;<br>
While all the flowers and trees do close<br>
To weave the garlands of repose.</div>

<p class = "first">
And then this one?</p>

<div class = "verse first">
Meanwhile the mind from pleasure less<br>
Withdraws into its happiness;<br>
The mind, that ocean where each kind<br>
Does straight its own resemblance find;<br>
<span class = "pagenum">92</span>
Yet it creates, transcending these,<br>
Far other worlds, and other seas;<br>
Annihilating all that's made<br>
To a green thought in a green shade.</div>

<div class = "speaker">
Mrs. Cromwell:</div>
<p>Yes. Far other worlds, and other seas. I wish your father would come.
I want to go to sleep, and you never know.</p>

<p>Why not always a commonwealth like this, father?</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Cromwell:</div>
<p>Hereafter there shall be a true commonwealth. We have done that for
England. But there must be a king. There is no one to follow me. I am an
interlude, as it were. But henceforth kings will be for the defence of
this realm, not to use it. That has been our work. It is so, mother?</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Mrs. Cromwell:</div>
<p>Truly, I think it. It will be a freer land because you have lived in
it, my son. Our name may be forgotten, but it does not matter. You serve
faithfully. I am proud.</p>

Cromwell:</div>
<p>That is an aim of mine&mdash;to find all men of worth and learning

them, I know. I would have none fail or want under my government.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Mrs. Cromwell:</div>
<p>I know that. Bridget, girl, be a stay to your father and your mother.
They love you. If you should wed again, may you wed well.</p>

<p>I will cherish my father's great estate, and I will be humble
always.</p>

<div class = "speaker">
Mrs. Cromwell:</div>
<p>And now, I am tired. Bless you, Oliver, my son. The Lord cause His
face to shine upon you, and comfort you in all your adversities, and
enable you to do great things for the glory of your most high God, and
to be a relief unto His people. My dear son. I leave my heart with you.

<p>Thou hast made me, though very unworthy, a mean instrument to do the
people some good, and Thee service. And many of them have set too high a
value upon me, though others wish and would be glad of my death. But,
Lord, however Thou dost dispose of me, continue and go on to do good for
them. Give them one heart, and mutual love. Teach those who look too
much upon Thy instrument to depend more upon Thyself. Pardon such as
desire to trample upon the dust of a poor worm, for they are Thy people,
too. And pardon the folly of this short prayer, even for Jesus Christ's
sake. And give us a good night if it be Thy pleasure.</p>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
